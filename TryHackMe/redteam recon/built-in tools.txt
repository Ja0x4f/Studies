- whois

   "WHOIS is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response protocol
   that is widely used to provide information services to Internet
   users.  While originally used to provide "white pages" services and
   information about registered domain names, current deployments cover
   a much broader range of information services.  The protocol delivers
   its content in a human-readable format.  This document updates the
   specification of the WHOIS protocol, thereby obsoleting RFC 954 [1]".
   
   https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3912.txt
   
The domain Register is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. whois will query the WHOIS server to provide all saved records. In the following example, we can see whois provides us with:

Register WHOIS server
Register URL
Record creation date
Record update date
Registrant contact info and address (unless withheld for privacy)
Admin contact info and address (unless withheld for privacy)
Tech contact info and address (unless withheld for privacy)

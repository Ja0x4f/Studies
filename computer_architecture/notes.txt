The Machine Code


A high level language is a human readable language, like PHP, Python, Java, etc. But it's not recognized by the computer.
The computer understand what is called "the machine code", like functions and instructions such as sum, keep, diff, etc.

For example:

An JavaScript code:

let a = 7;
let b = 2;
let c = a + b;
if (c !== 0){
  c++;
}

----------------------

A machine code:

set 7 in "a"
set 2 in "b"
take a
sum b
set in "c"
compair c and 0
if_equal_jump 1 line
add c

----------------------

What we understand: print(2+2) --> source code
What the machine understand: 001010000111010100110101000 --> the machine code (this is just an example ok?)

This traduction is done by the compiler, like gcc in C language.

# But what's the difference between an compiler and a interpreter?
The interpreted program is faster to edit and execute, because it's not needed to compile the source code. 
But the compiled programs are faster
